### 🏡 & 🎓
I am Giovanni and I come from Molise, a tiny but marvellous region in the south of Italy.
There, I got my Bachelor in CS before moving to Salerno to study for my Master (again, in CS).

### 👨‍💻
After my studies I worked for 1 year as IT Analysis and Developer at [Cedacri](http://www.cedacri.it/cedacri/it/index.html). Then, in 2016, I started a Ph.D. at the [s.e.a.l.](https://www.ifi.uzh.ch/en/seal.html) group at the University of Zürich. I mainly work in the area of Search-Based Software Testing (SBST), Software maintenance and evolution and Empirical Software Engineering (look [here](https://giograno.me/publications/) if you wanna know more about my work).

### 🏃‍♂️
In my spare time I try to be a good runner (you can follow my runs on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/20803711)).
Have a look at my profile on [World Athletics](https://www.worldathletics.org/athletes/italy/giovanni-grano-14386274) if you wanna know more.
I like doing research, coding, travelling, good coffee and good food. Lately, I bought a mirrorless camera.

- 🔭 I’m currently interning at JetBrains in Munich.
